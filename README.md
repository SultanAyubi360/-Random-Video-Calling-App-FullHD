## :tada: Random-Video-Calling-App-FullHD
A simple video calling application uses Firebase database and WebRTC API that enables you Peer-to-Peer Full-HD video and audio connection.

This is a simple video calling app called KOKO TALK. This enables you to connect with peers with secure connection without any mediatary server.


This app directly connect with a peer, and for initial connection it requires a server to get the data but after getting the connection data, it can able to make path by it's own.

This app using WebRTC API which uses server signaling and NATs for both devices internally. The actual RTC process is bit complicated, for that reason I use PeerJS for simplifying the connection process instead for being complicated for the application and user itself.
